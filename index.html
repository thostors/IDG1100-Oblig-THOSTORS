            1. The components that are apart of Von Neumans Architecture are the following: The Centeral Processing
            Unit (CPU) containing an arithmetic logic unit and a processor registers,
            A control unit, memory that stores data and instructions, external mass storage and input/output device.
        </p>

        <p>
            2. The user space is system memory that runs applications in a computer OS.
        </p>

        <p>
            3. The easy way to explain the shell would be that it is a program that takes the users commands and
            gives
            it to ur OS to perform.
            The many different commands can perform various task for your computer to do,
            the shell is a very powerful tool.
        </p>

        <p>
            4. The shell is located in the user space.
        </p>

        <p>
            5. The main task of the shell is to read and execute commands.

            6. The octal representation of a file that only can be read and written by its owner would be 6 0 0,
            6 as in read and write permissions for the owner, and 0 as in no permission for the rest.
        </p>
        <p>
            7. The common name for that user would be superuser.

        </p>
        <p>
            13. crontab -e, followed by further instructions such as when it should be scheduled and what it
            will do.
        </p>
        <p>
            14. kill 123
        </p>
        <p>
            15. sudo -s
        </p>
        <p>
            16. 30 * * * 7
        </p>
        <p>
            17. 30 * 15 * *
        </p>
        <p>
            18. 30 05 * 6 0-1
        </p>
        <div>
            <p>
                24. STEP 1. Firstly you need to access the root user using the command "sudo -s" followed by password.
            </p>
            <p>
                STEP 2. Create your cronjob with command "crontab -e" and select editor (my editor is nano)
            </p>
            <p>
            Step 3. Then on to creating the cronjob that prints "Task scheduled at date" every 30 minutes today
            <br>
            - You now need to make a file for the script to output. use "touch filename.txt" to create your txt file.
            (filename is up to you)
            <br>
            - Set the schedule for the cronjob, for this task it is todays date + every 30 mintues. for me it will be 30
            * 20 11 5, since its friday the 20th november while making this tutorial.
            <br>
            - Find the path of the txt file you created earlier, i created tutorial.txt inside IDG1100 so for me its
            home/thostors/IDG1100/tutorial.txt
            <br>
            - Now create an echo for the cronjob to execute. For this task we will echo "Task scheduled at $(date)
            <br>
            - Combine the steps to create the script "30 * 19 11 4 echo "Task scheduled at $(date)" >>
            home/thostors/IDG1100/tutorial.txt"
            </p>
            <p>
                STEP 4. Now to start the cronjob. First time start-up, use "service cron status" to see if it is running
                or
                not. If its not running use "serice cron start". Use "service cron status" to confirm that you have
                started
                it.
            </p>
            <p>
                STEP 5. After 30 mintues check your output file to see if the cronjob did its job. For me it looked like
                this "Task scheduled at Fri Nov 20 12:28:01 CET 2020".
